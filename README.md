A Modern, Opinionated Multicall Library

## Overview

Adapted from Makerdao's [`multicall`](), this library provides a simple way to call multiple contracts at once.

Built with [`foundry`](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry), parcels is rigorously tested and maintained.

## Blueprint

â”œâ”€ forge-std â€” https://github.com/brockelmore/forge-std
â”œâ”€ solmate â€” https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate
â”œâ”€ clones-with-immutable-args â€” https://github.com/wighawag/clones-with-immutable-args
src
â”œâ”€ tests
â”‚  â””â”€ Greeter.t â€” "Greeter Tests"
â””â”€ Greeter â€” "A Minimal Greeter Contract"
```

## Development

#### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Don't have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed?
Run
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰

#### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

#### Setup

```bash
make
# OR #
make setup
```

#### Install DappTools

Install DappTools using their [installation guide](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation).


#### Build

```bash
make build
```

#### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```
